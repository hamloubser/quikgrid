QuikGrid is a library which can:
  1. Use a sparse set of 3D points, and generate a heightfield grid by interpolation.
> 2. Use a heightfield grid, and produce a set of contour vectors.
It is small, fast, simple and platform-independent.  Originally written by John Coulthard of Perspective Edge Software, the library component was later released under the LGPL.
